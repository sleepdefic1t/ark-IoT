It can be confusing diving into the world of raspberry pi,
and we all move forward together!  
Feel free to suggest any resources and improvements!  


## Where do I get a Raspberry Pi?  
In no particular order..  

- [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/raspberrypi)  
- [ThePiHut](https://thepihut.com/)  
- [Canakit](https://www.canakit.com/)  
- [microcenter](http://www.microcenter.com/brand/4294866729/raspberry-pi)  
- [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi/pages/5811495011)  




## What is a good OS to start with?
More will be added soon, but these are the go-to distributions for raspberry pi.

- [RASPBIAN STRETCH LITE](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)  
   Minimal image based on Debian Stretch

- [RASPBIAN STRETCH WITH DESKTOP](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)  
   Image with desktop based on Debian Stretch

 


##  Setting up your pi    
I recommend headless mode as it gives much less overhead to run a pi with a full graphical desktop  
  when might not need it at all.
